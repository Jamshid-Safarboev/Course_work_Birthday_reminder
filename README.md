Birthday Reminder Application Report

1. Introduction

The Birthday Reminder application is a Python program designed to help users keep track of birthdays and receive notifications for upcoming events. It allows users to add, remove, and view birthdays, as well as export/import data to/from CSV files.

The program can be run by executing the Python script. To add a birthday, call the `add_birthday` method on a `BirthdayReminder` object. To remove a birthday, call the `remove_birthday` method. To print all reminders, call the `print_reminders` method. To send notifications for today's birthdays, call the `send_notification` method.

Once the program is running, users can interact with it via a command-line interface. They can add birthdays for different individuals, remove existing birthdays, view all reminders, and receive notifications for birthdays occurring on the current day.

Abstraction:
The Reminder abstract base class defines two abstract methods: send_notification() and print_reminders().
Concrete classes (like BirthdayReminder) inherit from Reminder and implement these methods.
Users interact with high-level methods without needing to know the internal details.
class Reminder(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send_notification(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def print_reminders(self):
        pass

Encapsulation

class BirthdayReminder(Reminder):
    def __init__(self, user):
        self.user = user
        self.birthdays = {}

    def add_birthday(self, name, date):
        # ...

    def remove_birthday(self, name):
        # ...

    def print_reminders(self):
        # ...

    def send_notification(self):
        # ...

class ReminderFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_reminder(reminder_type, user):
        # ...
The BirthdayReminder class encapsulates user data (birthdays) and related methods.
Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass).
It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy.
2. Body/Analysis

The Birthday Reminder program implements the following functional requirements:
- Adding and removing birthdays: Users can add birthdays using the `add_birthday` method of the `BirthdayReminder` class and remove birthdays using the `remove_birthday` method.
- Viewing reminders: The `print_reminders` method of the `BirthdayReminder` class allows users to view all birthdays stored in the system.
- Sending notifications: The program sends notifications for birthdays occurring on the current day using the `send_notification` method of the `BirthdayReminder` class.
- Exporting/importing data: The `CSVHandler` class provides methods (`export_to_csv` and `import_from_csv`) to export birthdays to a CSV file and import data from a CSV file, respectively.

Here are some codes that cover requirements:

class BirthdayReminder(Reminder):
    def __init__(self, user):
        self.user = user
        self.birthdays = {}

    def add_birthday(self, name, date):
        self.birthdays[name] = date

    def remove_birthday(self, name):
        if name in self.birthdays:
            del self.birthdays[name]

    def print_reminders(self):
        for name, date in self.birthdays.items():
            print(f"{name}'s birthday is on {date}")

    def send_notification(self):
        today = datetime.date.today()
        for name, date in self.birthdays.items():
            b_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(date, "%Y-%m-%d").date()
            if b_date.month == today.month and b_date.day == today.day:
                print(f"Notification: Today is {name}'s birthday!")


3. Results and Summary

  - Successfully implemented all functional requirements of the Birthday Reminder application.
  - Faced challenges in handling CSV files and integrating email notifications, but these were overcome through thorough testing and debugging.

4. As a Conclusion, 
  - The Birthday Reminder program provides a simple yet effective solution for managing birthdays and receiving timely notifications.
  - Future prospects include enhancing user interface, implementing user authentication, and integrating additional notification methods.
 - The Birthday Reminder project effectively utilizes OOP principles, making it modular, maintainable, and extensible. Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism contribute to its robust design.
