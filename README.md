Birthday Reminder Application Report

1. Introduction

The Birthday Reminder application is a Python program designed to help users keep track of birthdays and receive notifications for upcoming events. It allows users to add, remove, and view birthdays, as well as export/import data to/from CSV files.

The program can be run by executing the Python script. To add a birthday, call the `add_birthday` method on a `BirthdayReminder` object. To remove a birthday, call the `remove_birthday` method. To print all reminders, call the `print_reminders` method. To send notifications for today's birthdays, call the `send_notification` method.

Once the program is running, users can interact with it via a command-line interface. They can add birthdays for different individuals, remove existing birthdays, view all reminders, and receive notifications for birthdays occurring on the current day.

2. Body/Analysis.
The provided program is a well-structured example of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. It demonstrates the four pillars of OOP: Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Polymorphism: This is when a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class. In our code, the send_notification and print_reminders methods in the Reminder class are overridden in the BirthdayReminder class. Also, the EmailNotificationDecoratorclass overrides the send_notification method.
class Reminder(ABC):  # Abstract base class
    @abstractmethod
    def send_notification(self):  # Abstract method
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def print_reminders(self):  # Abstract method
        pass

class BirthdayReminder(Reminder):  # Inherits from Reminder
    def print_reminders(self):  # Overridden method
        ...

    def send_notification(self):  # Overridden method
        ...

class EmailNotificationDecorator(Reminder):  # Inherits from Reminder
    def send_notification(self):  # Overridden method
        ...

Abstraction: This is when a class provides an interface for its subclasses but does not provide a complete implementation. In our code, the Reminder class is an abstract base class (ABC) that provides an interface for its subclasses. It defines two abstract methods: send_notification and print_reminders.
class Reminder(ABC):  # Abstract base class
    @abstractmethod
    def send_notification(self):  # Abstract method
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def print_reminders(self):  # Abstract method
        pass

Inheritance: This is when a class inherits properties and methods from another class. In our code, the BirthdayReminder and EmailNotificationDecorator classes inherit from the Reminder class.
class Reminder(ABC):  # Abstract base class
    ...

class BirthdayReminder(Reminder):  # Inherits from Reminder
    ...

class EmailNotificationDecorator(Reminder):  # Inherits from Reminder
    ...

Encapsulation: This is when a class hides its internal details and exposes only what is necessary. In our code, the BirthdayReminder class encapsulates the details of how birthdays are stored and managed. It provides methods to add and remove birthdays, and to send notifications and print reminders. The CSVHandler class encapsulates the details of how CSV files are handled.
class BirthdayReminder(Reminder):  # Inherits from Reminder
    def __init__(self, user):  # Constructor method
        self.user = user  # Private attribute
        self.birthdays = {}  # Private attribute

    def add_birthday(self, name, date):  # Public method
        ...

    def remove_birthday(self, name):  # Public method
        ...

    def print_reminders(self):  # Public method
        ...

    def send_notification(self):  # Public method
        ...

class CSVHandler:  # Encapsulates CSV handling
    @staticmethod
    def export_to_csv(filename, data):  # Public method
        ...

    @staticmethod
    def import_from_csv(filename):  # Public method
        ...

3. Results:
•	The program successfully implements the four pillars of object-oriented programming: Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.
•	The BirthdayReminder class effectively manages birthday reminders and sends notifications, demonstrating the practical application of these OOP concepts.
•	The CSVHandler class provides a way to persistently store and retrieve data, which is a crucial aspect of many real-world applications.
•	One challenge faced during implementation was ensuring that the EmailNotificationDecorator class correctly extends the functionality of the Reminder class without modifying its original behavior.
4. Conclusion:
•	This work has achieved a solid understanding and application of the four pillars of object-oriented programming. It has resulted in a program that can manage birthday reminders, send notifications, and handle CSV file operations.
•	The result of this program is a flexible and extendable system for managing reminders. It can be easily extended to handle different types of reminders and notifications.
•	Future prospects of this program include extending it to handle different types of reminders (e.g., meetings, anniversaries), integrating it with an email server to send actual email notifications, and adding a user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
